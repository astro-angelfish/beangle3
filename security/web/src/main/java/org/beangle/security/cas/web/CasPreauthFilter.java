/**
 * Processes a CAS service ticket.
 * <p>
 * A service ticket consists of an opaque ticket string. It arrives at this filter by the user's
 * browser successfully authenticating using CAS, and then receiving a HTTP redirect to a
 * <code>service</code>. The opaque ticket string is presented in the <code>ticket</code> request
 * parameter. This filter monitors the <code>service</code> URL so it can receive the service ticket
 * and process it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Processing the service ticket involves creating a <code>PreauthAuthentication</code> which uses
 * {@link CasAuthentication#STATEFUL_ID} for the <code>principal</code> and the opaque ticket string
 * as the <code>credentials</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The configured <code>AuthenticationManager</code> is expected to provide a provider that can
 * recognise <code>PreauthAuthentication</code>s containing this special <code>principal</code>
 * name, and process them accordingly by validation with the CAS server.
 * </p>

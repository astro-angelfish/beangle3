 * Will create Authentication object (and attach it to the SecurityContextHolder), if such object
 * does not exist yet.
 * <p>
 * As with most pre-authenticated scenarios, it is essential that the external authentication system
 * is set up correctly as this filter does no authentication whatsoever. All the protection is
 * assumed to be provided externally and if this filter is included inappropriately in a
 * configuration, it would be possible to assume the identity of a user merely by setting the
 * correct header name. This also means it should not be used in combination with other Beangle
 * Security authentication mechanisms such as form login, as this would imply there was a means of
 * bypassing the external system which would be risky.

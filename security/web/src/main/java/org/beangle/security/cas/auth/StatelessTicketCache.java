/**
 * Caches CAS service tickets and CAS proxy tickets for stateless connections.
 * <p>
 * When a service ticket or proxy ticket is validated against the CAS server, it is unable to be
 * used again. Most types of callers are stateful and are associated with a given
 * <code>HttpSession</code>. This allows the affirmative CAS validation outcome to be stored in the
 * <code>HttpSession</code>, meaning the removal of the ticket from the CAS server is not an issue.
 * </p>
 * <P>
 * Stateless callers, such as remoting protocols, cannot take advantage of <code>HttpSession</code>.
 * If the stateless caller is located a significant network distance from the CAS server, acquiring
 * a fresh service ticket or proxy ticket for each invocation would be expensive.
 * </p>
 * <P>
 * To avoid this issue with stateless callers, it is expected stateless callers will obtain a single
 * service ticket or proxy ticket, and then present this same ticket to the Beangle Security secured
 * application on each occasion. As no <code>HttpSession</code> is available for such callers, the
 * affirmative CAS validation outcome cannot be stored in this location.
 * </p>
 * <P>
 * The <code>StatelessTicketCache</code> enables the service tickets and proxy tickets belonging to
 * stateless callers to be placed in a cache. This in-memory cache stores the
 * <code>CasAuthentication</code>, effectively providing the same capability as a
 * <code>HttpSession</code> with the ticket identifier being the key rather than a session
 * identifier.
 * </p>
 * <P>
 * Implementations should provide a reasonable timeout on stored entries, such that the stateless
 * caller are not required to unnecessarily acquire fresh CAS service tickets or proxy tickets.
